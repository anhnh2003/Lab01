Question:
- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build 
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Answer:
- Java does allow programmers to do this. However, if the programmers do this 
(declare 2 constructor methods with the same number of parameters and types), 
Java cannot identify which constructor to be used whenever it is called.
